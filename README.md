## HashiCorp Consul on the AWS Cloud
Consul version: 1.7.0

HashiCorp Consul is a tool that provides the foundation of cloud networking automation using a central registry for service-based networking. Consulâ€™s core use cases include:

* Service registry & health monitoring, to provide a real-time directory of all services with their health status;
* Network middleware automation, with service discovery for dynamic reconfiguration as services scale up, down or move;
* Zero trust network with service mesh, to secure service-to-service traffic with identity-based security policies and encrypted traffic with Mutual-TLS.

Each stack in this deployment takes approximately 10 minutes to create. For more information and step-by-step deployment instructions, see the [deployment guide](https://aws-quickstart.s3.amazonaws.com/quickstart-hashicorp-consul/doc/hashicorp-consul-on-the-aws-cloud.pdf).

### Deployment Options
* Deployment of HashiCorp Consul into a new VPC (end-to-end deployment) builds a new VPC with public and private subnets, and then deploys HashiCorp Vault into that infrastructure.
* Deployment of HashiCorp Consul into an existing VPC provisions HashiCorp Vault into your existing infrastructure.
